Mido - MIDI Objects for Python
==============================

Mido is a library for working with MIDI messages and ports. It's
designed to be as straight forward and Pythonic as possible:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import mido
   >>> msg = mido.Message('note_on', note=60)
   >>> msg.note
   60
   >>> msg.bytes()
   [144, 60, 64]
   >>> msg.copy(channel=2)
   <message note_on channel=2 note=60 velocity=64 time=0>

.. code-block:: python

    with mido.open_input('LinnStrument') as inport:
        for msg in inport:
            print(msg)

.. code-block:: python

   port = mido.open_output()
   port.send(msg)

.. code-block:: python

    mid = mido.MidiFile('song.mid')
    for msg in mid.play():
        port.send(msg)

Main Features
-------------

* works in Python 2 and 3.

* convenient message objects.

* supports RtMidi, PortMidi and Pygame. New backends are easy to
  write.

* full support for all 18 messages defined by the MIDI standard.

* standard port API allows all kinds of input and output ports to be
  used interchangeably. New port types can be written by subclassing
  and overriding a few methods.

* includes a reusable MIDI parser.

* full support for MIDI files (read, write, create and play) with
  complete access to every message in the file, including all common
  meta messages.

* can read and write SYX files (binary and plain text).

* implements (somewhat experimental) MIDI over TCP/IP with socket
  ports. This allows for example wireless MIDI between two
  computers.

* includes programs for playing MIDI files, listing ports and
  serving and forwarding ports over a network.
